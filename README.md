# gulp_ECMA6

## setup for GULP type module

unfortunatly we can't get rid of package.json overrides to have no vulnerabilities

npm audit --fix is not effective in this task

you find detailed information on [stack overflow "Why do I keep getting an error when trying to install gulp?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70963372/why-do-i-keep-getting-an-error-when-trying-to-install-gulp)

but in the end we can use the latest npm packages what is at last not bad ;-)

1. clone repository
2. run mpn install
3. Happy coding ðŸ¤“
